<p>There are a large variety of dog breeds to choose from. Knowing which one you want all depends on preferences such as size, energy level and allergies. Since this is a broad subject it is wise to do some research before you make a decision. When you have an idea of what you are looking for you can select how you want get a dog. There are many local shelters that have a wide variety of dogs from mixed breeds to pure bred. If you decide you want to adopt then select the Local Shelters below and you will be provided a link to go petfinder.com. Local shelters don't alway have puppies and if you want to start from the beginning then you can select Reputable Breeders. That button will provide you a link to look up reputable dog breeders through the akc.org site.</p>

            <p>You want whats best for your dog, but you also might want to stay within budget. When owning a dog there will be some necessary items such as food, treats, toys, grooming and flea protection.

This is just an estimation that may vary depending on the size, breed and individual needs of your pet.</p>

/*For the discussion project for Chapter 4 I attempted to implement the try and catch statements into my code for dog page form. I unfortunately was not able to acheive the end result in which an error message would pop up stating that no items have been selected. That was the first way I tried to use the statement, after that didn't work I attempted to use it for the submit function of the page. If no items were selected and the user hit the submit button an error message would pop up stating to select an item to estimate the cost for the year. This also didn't work and ended up disabling the function for generating the yearlytotals, so I commented the statement out so you can see what I attempted to do. I attempted many different variations of the try statement but none seemed to work.I finally was able to implement the try catch and finally statement within my function for yearTotal. When the submit button is clicked with a value of $0 a message will appear asking the user to please select an item. */
